# Trip-Package-Planner
The idea is to create an application that will provide the user a suitable trip plan according to their need.

The application will take input from the user about the location they
want to visit, minimum and maximum budget type of hotel (e.g.: 1*, 2*, 3*, 4*, 5*) etc. The
application will propose a details of the tour package having hotel name, location
suggestions, total tour package price, places that will be visited etc.

This project is a part of Data Structure and Algorithms Lab, 3rd Semester, 2nd year.

### Notes
This project was created and tested under Windows, and it doesn't work fully in other systems

This project is still under development. Parts of the source codes may not be well documented.
Also suitable prompts may not be available for the user at the moment.

More features and fixes are yet to come. Meanwhile suggestions, ideas, bug reports are welcomed.

I am a python n00bie! I am still learning python! I have tried my best to give in as much effort required (of course directly proportionate to my knowledge), for this project.
